# Human Activity Detection

This project aims to detect and classify human activities using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains data collected from multiple sensors, and this project leverages Python and various data analysis libraries to preprocess, train, and evaluate a model that can predict different human activities.

## Overview

Human Activity Detection is a classification task where the goal is to accurately determine the type of activity a person is performing based on sensor data. This project uses sensor data from accelerometers and gyroscopes to classify activities such as walking, running, standing, and more.

## Features

- Preprocessing of raw sensor data
- Feature extraction and engineering
- Training and evaluating machine learning models
- Visualization of results and model performance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkag/Human-Activity-Detection.git
   cd Human-Activity-Detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.

   ```bash
   python src/preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**: Train a model on the preprocessed data.

   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

   ```bash
   python src/evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. **Visualization**: Use Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and visualize model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains time-series data from wearable sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Ensure the dataset is stored in the `data/` folder before running any scripts.

> **Note**: If you are using a specific dataset, include details about the source, attributes, and labels in this section.

## Model Training

The project supports various machine learning models, including:

- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Deep learning models (optional)

The `train_model.py` script allows you to choose the model type and fine-tune hyperparameters.

## Results

After training, the model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations of these metrics are available in the `results/` directory.
